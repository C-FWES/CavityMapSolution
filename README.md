# CavityMapSolution
Solution to the Cavity Map Challenge from HackerRank

The solution to this problem was that you just needed to see if your test case met four cases
You can do this by iterating through the 2D Array and checking in the first row first
If the value from the first row meets the criteria than you know of course the test cases in the "range" of the first case will not be able to meet the criteria
Than you iterate through values that are not in the range of the first cavity and check
